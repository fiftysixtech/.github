# Fiftysix: Strategic Tech Consulting for Startups

Welcome to Fiftysix - a hands-on consultancy helping founders, startups, and small teams build smarter with web development, blockchain, automation, and AI.

We deliver solutions through project-based builds, technical advising, and infrastructure automation. From strategy to code, we simplify complex tech and accelerate execution so you can focus on building.

## About Us

> “The best technologies amplify what people were always capable of.”
> — Daniel Peter, Founder of Fiftysix

Fiftysix was founded to remove the friction between ideas and impact. We work directly with founders and operators to plan, build, and automate products that save time, reduce costs, and scale intelligently.

We believe startups shouldn't have to choose between speed and strategy. Whether you're launching your first MVP, optimizing your backend, or need a quality website for cheap, we handle the hard parts.
