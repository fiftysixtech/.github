# Fiftysix: The Decentralization Company

Welcome! Our mission is to make blockchain technology accessible, efficient, and reliable through decentralization. We're dedicated to supporting the blockchain ecosystem by building, hosting, and educating on decentralized networks.

## Manifesto

> "What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party." - Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin Whitepaper

Fiftysix empowers individuals and organizations to engage with blockchain technology by lowering barriers to entry.

The blockchain space has grown significantly since the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. However, the core principles of decentralization are often overlooked in favor of speed and cost. We strive to address this imbalance by focusing on network decentralization.
