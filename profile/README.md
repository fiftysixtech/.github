# Fiftysix: Technical Advisory for Founders

Fiftysix is a technical advisory focused on helping founders think clearly and make confident technical decisions.

Rather than selling predefined projects or acting as a traditional agency, Fiftysix works alongside founders in an ongoing advisory capacity — holding context, clarifying tradeoffs, and helping teams choose grounded paths forward as products take shape.

Our work sits at the intersection of practical engineering, emotional intelligence, and long-term judgment.

## About Us

> "I help founders think clearly so they can build in a way that still feels like them."
> — Daniel Peter, Founder of Fiftysix

Fiftysix was founded to reduce confusion around technical decisions.

We work directly with founders and small teams as a steady technical thinking partner, helping them reason through architecture, infrastructure, product direction, and emerging technologies without unnecessary urgency or complexity.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Advisory and consulting work may include:

- Technical and architectural review
- Clarifying tradeoffs and risks
- Systems and infrastructure reasoning
- Research and synthesis around emerging tools
- Decision framing and prioritization
- Selective implementation when helpful

Engagements are ongoing, contextual, and relationship-based rather than transactional.
